Welcome to my blog!

I am Sisung from Korea and am studying Data Science in Germany. You can call me Crimson. It is the color of my bachelor university, and I am using it as my nicname.

This is a place to study together. While you learn from the knowledges I write, I will also learn more since deeper understanding is required to post them.

Although not many posts are here because I just opened this page, please enjoy your time here.
