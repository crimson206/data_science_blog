      <description>Introduction#The fundamental concept behind gradient descent is to minimize a function \(E = E(w)\). The gradient \(\nabla_\mathbf{W} E\)indicates the direction in which \(E\)increases the fastest at a point, and the objective is to modify the values of \(\mathbf{W}\)iteratively to minimize \(E\). This is achieved by updating the values of \(w\)as follows:
\[\mathbf{W}^{\prime}=\mathbf{W}-\eta \nabla_\mathbf{W} E \]Here, \(\eta\)is the learning rate.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my blog!
This blog is dedicated to sharing what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned, with a focus on data science. I am passionate about topics like machine learning, artificial intelligence, and autonomous programming.
The main purpose of this webpage is to provide educational content and insights into the fascinating field of data science. As I continue to deepen my understanding and knowledge, I will share valuable information with you.
While the majority of the posts will revolve around data science, I may also explore other related topics.</description>
